    - I actually feel I got this one pretty close, but if there are any issues at all, I'm always looking for constructive criticism
        - On that note, I definitely still get hung up on, "Am I doing this efficiently/correctly?"

                    I'm writing a paragraph long enough to hopefully get a few lines in. I need to test this CSS and make sure that the text is working as expected.
                    I'll have to position it to the right but I really don't understand the position property in CSS. It kind of makes sense, but I feel that way about
                    the rest of CSS. Seems impossible so far.
                </p>

                    This is another paragraph just to test limits. My favorite game of all time is Super Smash Bros melee. I've played it competitively for many years now,
                    and it just never gets old. I play daily as a stress relief and I couldn't love it more still. If I could make a living from it, I would.

                    I do hope that this bootcamp pans out and I can actually start writing some real software. I don't actually want to go to Dev, but if I must, I will.
                    I just don't want to be stuck on tickets forever. And maybe Chad's t-shirt business will actually take off. I'd like to write the site for that and 
                    ride out that money gravy train.
